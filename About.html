                My name is Adam Hutt, most people usually call me "Wally" or "Hutt". I was born and rasied in Sydney, Australia and currently living in Tokyo, Japan. For the past ten years or so, I've been lucky enough to be able to travel and temporarily live in some other countries around the world. I've been able to do this through Working Holiday Visas. My longest stays are Japan (Tokyo, Niseko, Onomichi) , UK(London, Liverpool) , France(Chamonix) , Canada(Toronto, Sunpeaks) and of course trying to see as much of these countries as I can. Im very grateful for these experience and have helped me understand the benefits of knowledge, communication and experiencing new challenges and environments.

                I think Im a relaxed, positive person and like to be social and try new things. Enjoying myself and having free-time to spend time with friends and family and experience new things is something I value greatly. However I feel its important to earn this free-time and try to maintain a strong work ethic. Over the last few years I've learned the importance of goal-setting, which as helped me manage my time more actively to achieve goals both personally and career-wise.
