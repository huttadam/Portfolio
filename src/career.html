                    <p>As mentioned in the About page. Ive been living abroad for the most part of my professional life. I've tried several different part-time jobs over and holdover jobs during this time but my Id say my background/training would be Freight Fowarding and English Teaching.
                    (CV attached below.) These are the industries I have worked  in, for the longest and consistent amount of time. Although these jobs are interesting,I feel important to challenge myself, learn something new and start to build a career for the future, which is why
                    I've decided to start working towards joing the IT and Web Industries.
                    Ive always had a keen interest in computers and and the technical side of them and looking forward to getting further knowledge on them. 
                    Throughout my career , Ive gained a lot of experience which has helped me devlop a strong work ethic. Im easy-going, willing to listen and happy to work in a team or by myself.</p>

                        <p>My descion to start this journey was made 2 years ago. During this time I've tried online learning schools and a Foundations course at another bootcamp in Tokyo.
                            Ive enjoyed this journey so far but feel Im just getting bits and peices of knowledge and the industry, which led to my decision to enrol in Coder Academy Australia.
                            Already a few weeks in, I feel like Ive expanded my knowledge base knowlede of HTML/CSS and have learned very standard industry practices like Git and Temrinal.
                            I'm also looking forward to expanding on previously learned languages such as JavaScript and Python. Please see below as example of what Ive worked on previously. Below is a website
                            i have been using to study Javascript. Its themed around Karate and is a lot of fun. Its called codewars.com </p>

                    <img src = "/img/page-photos/career-photos/aspirations.jpg" alt="asp"></img>
                    <p> My main aspiration for the long term would simply working in the industry as a dev and continuing to gain knowledge. I feel I have a suface level undertsanding of
                        a typical software developer job would be like and the expectation in the role. More importantly in the short-term , I would like to finish this course and improve my skill-set in a wide-variety of
                        programs and tools to assist in job-hunting. Of course this website being one of them. Having only been in the course a few weeks and learned so much already, Im cofident I can build on what I learned 
                        already know and continue to learn.
